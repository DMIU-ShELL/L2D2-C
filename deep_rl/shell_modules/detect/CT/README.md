# Task Dissimilarity
- The class [dissimilarity](https://github.com/DMIU-ShELL/deeprl-shell/blob/main/deep_rl/shell_modules/detect/CT/dissimilarity.py) takes tasks (represented by a dictionary) as input, computes the Wasserstein Embedding of each task and outputs the pairwise Euclidean distance among the embeddings.

- [CT_graph](https://github.com/DMIU-ShELL/deeprl-shell/blob/main/deep_rl/shell_modules/detect/CT/CT_graph.ipynb) demonstrates how to calculate the dissimilarities among the randomly generated CT_graph tasks.
